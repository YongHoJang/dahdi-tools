# This is an optional configuration file for ordering
# Dahdi registration.
#
# It is read from /etc/dahdi/xpp_order. This location
# may be overriden via the environment variable XPPORDER_CONF
#
# Lines may contain:
#   - The Astribank label (verbatim)
#   - The Astribank connector string (prefixed with @)
# Ordering number of each listed Astribank is determined
# by its position in this file.
# Astribanks not listed in this file, get an ordering
# number of 99 (last).
#
# Astribanks with same ordering number are sorted by their
# connectors (to preserve legacy behaviour).
#
# Examples:
#usb:1234
#@usb-0000:06:02.2-2
